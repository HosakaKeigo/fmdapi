# Claris FileMaker Data API Client for TypeScript

This package is designed to make working with the FileMaker Data API much easier. Here's just a few key features:

- [Otto](https://ottofms.com/) Data API proxy support
- TypeScript support for easy auto-completion of your fields
- Automated type generation based on layout metadata

## Installation

```sh
npm install @proofgeist/fmdapi
# or
yarn add @proofgeist/fmdapi
```

## Usage

Add the following envnironment variables to your project's `.env.local` file:

```sh
FM_DATABASE=filename.fmp12
FM_SERVER=https://filemaker.example.com

# if you want to use the Otto Data APi Proxy
OTTO_API_KEY=KEY_123456...789
# otherwise
FM_USERNAME=admin
FM_PASSWORD=password
```

Initialize the client with your FileMaker Server credentials:

```typescript
import { DataApi } from "@proofgeist/fmdapi";

const client = DataApi({
  auth: { apiKey: process.env.OTTO_API_KEY },
  db: process.env.FM_DATABASE,
  server: process.env.FM_SERVER,
});
```

Then, use the client to query your FileMaker database. Availble methods:

- `list` return all records from a given layout
- `find` perform a FileMaker find
- `get` return a single record by recordID
- `create` return a new record
- `update` modify a single record by recordID
- `delete` delete a single record by recordID
- `metadata` return metadata for a given layout
- `disconnect` forcibly logout of your FileMaker session (available when not using Otto Data API proxy)

This package also includes some helper methods to make working with Data API responses a little easier:

- `findOne` return the first record from a find instead of an array. This method will error unless exactly 1 record is found.
- `findFirst` return the first record from a find instead of an array, but will not error if multiple records are found.

...more helper methods planned

Basic Example:

```typescript
const result = await client.list({ layout: "Contacts" });
```

### Client Setup Options

| Option   | Type     | Description                                                                                  |
| -------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `auth`   | `object` | Authentication object. Must contain either `apiKey` or `username` and `password`             |
| `db`     | `string` | FileMaker database name                                                                      |
| `server` | `string` | FileMaker server URL (must include `https://`)                                               |
| `layout` | `string` | _(optional)_ If provided, will be the layout used for all methods if not otherwise specified |

## TypeScript Support

The basic client will return the generic FileMaker response object by default. You can also create a type for your exepcted response and get a fully typed response that includes your own fields.

```typescript
type TContact = {
  name: string;
  email: string;
  phone: string;
};
const result = await client.list<TContact>({ layout: "Contacts" });
```

## Automatic Type Generation

This package also includes a helper function that will automatically generate types for each of your layouts. Use this tool regularly during development to easily keep your types updated with any schema changes in FileMaker. ðŸ¤¯

The generated file also produces a layout-specific client instance that will automatically type all of the methods for that layout **and** validates the response using the [`zod`](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) library. This validaiton happens at runtime so you can protect against dangerous field changes even when you haven't ran the code generator recently, or in your projection deployment!

### Setup instructions:

1. Add a schema configuation file to the root of your project

```sh
yarn codegen --init
```

2. Edit the configuration file (`fmschema.config.js`) to include your FileMaker layouts (see more configuration options below).
3. Run the `codegen` command to generate your types!

```sh
yarn codegen
```

Assuming you have a layout called `customer_api` containing `name` `phone` and `email` fields for a customer, the generated code will look like this:

```typescript
// schema/Customer.ts
import { z } from "zod";
import { DataApi } from "@proofgeist/fmdapi";
export const ZCustomer = z.object({
  name: z.string(),
  phone: z.string(),
  email: z.string(),
});
export type TCustomer = z.infer<typeof ZCustomer>;
export const client = DataApi<any, TCustomer>(
  {
    auth: { apiKey: process.env.OTTO_API_KEY },
    db: process.env.FM_DATABASE,
    server: process.env.FM_SERVER,
    layout: "customer_api",
  },
  { fieldData: ZCustomer }
);
```

You can use the exported types to type your own client, or simply use the generated client to get typed and validated results, like so:

```ts
import { client } from "schema/Customer";
...
const result = await client.list(); // result will be fully typed and validated!
```

## What's new in v3

Version 3 uses the native `fetch` module from Node 18 and is no longer dependent on `node-fetch`. Node version 18 or later is now required to install this package.

This change was made to take advantage of caching if used in a Next 13 app. You can pass in additonal options to the `fetch` function for each method. For example:

```ts
client.list({ fetch: { next: { revalidate: 10 } } });
```

## FAQ

### I don't like the way the code is generated. Can I edit the generated files?

They are just files added to your project, so you technically can, but we don't recommend it, as it would undermine the main benefit of being able to re-run the script at a later date when the schema changesâ€”all your edits would be overritten. If you need to extend the types, it's better to do extend them into a new type/zod schema in another file. Or, if you have suggesstions for the underlying engine, Pull Requests are welcome!

### Do I have to install `zod` for this package to work?

No, but we reccomend it! Zod is included as a depenency with this package and used under the hood when you use the generated layout-specific client to validate the responses from your server. If you wish to disable the validation, you can pass `useZod: false` to the generated client.

### Why are number fields typed as a `string | number`?

FileMaker may return numbers as strings in certain cases (such as very large numbers in scientific notation or blank fields). This ensures you properly account for this in your frontend code. If you wish to force all numbers to be typed as `number | null`, you can enable the `strictNumbers` flag per schema in your definition.

**WARNING:** the `strictNumbers` setting is disabled by default because it may result in false types if you are not using Zod or the auto-generated layout specific client. It works by applying a transformer to the zod schema to force all number fields to be either `number` or `null`.

### How does the code generation handle Value Lists?

Values lists are exported as their own types within the schema file, but they are not enforced within the schema by default because the actual data in the field may not be fully validated.

If you want the type to be enforced to a value from the value list, you can enable the `strictValueLists` flag per schema in your definition. This feature is only reccommended when you're also using the Zod library, as your returned data will fail the validation if the value is not in the value list.

### What about date/time/timestamp fields?

For now, these are all typed as strings. You probably want to transform these values anyway, so we keep it simple at the automated level.

### Can I run the `codegen` command in a CI/CD environment?

Yes, great idea! This could be a great way to catch errors that would arise from any changes to the FileMaker schema.

### Why Zod instead of just TypeScript?

**In short:** Zod is a TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library. When you use it, you get _runtime_ validation of your data instead of just compile-time validation.

FileMaker is great for being able to change schema very quickly and easily. Yes, you probably have naming conventions in place that help protect against these changes in your web apps, but no system is perfect. Zod lets you start with the assumption that any data coming from an external API might be in a format that you don't expect and then valdiates it so that you can catch errors early. This allows the typed object that it returns to you to be much more trusted throughout your app.

**But wait, does this mean that I might get a fatal error in my production app if the FileMaker schema changes?** Yes, yes it does. This is actually what you'd want to happen. Without validating the data returned from an API, it's possible to get other unexpcted side-effects in your app that don't present as errors, which may lead to bugs that are hard to track down or inconsistencies in your data.
