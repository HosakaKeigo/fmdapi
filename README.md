# Claris FileMaker Data API Client for TypeScript
This package is designed to make working with the FileMaker Data API much easier. Here's just a few key features:
- [Otto](https://ottofms.com/) Data API proxy support
- A lightweight code bundle
- TypeScript support for easy auto-completion of your fields
- Automated type generation based on layout metadata

## Installation

```sh
npm install @proofgeist/fm-dapi
# or
yarn add @proofgeist/fm-dapi
```

## Usage
Add the following envnironment variables to your project's `.env` file:

```sh
OTTO_API_KEY=KEY_123456...789
FM_DATABASE=filename.fmp12
FM_SERVER=https://filemaker.example.com
```

Initialize the client with your FileMaker Server credentials:

```typescript
import { DataApi } from "@proofgeist/fm-dapi";

const client = DataApi({
  auth: { apiKey: process.env.OTTO_API_KEY },
  db: process.env.FM_DATABASE,
  server: process.env.FM_SERVER,
});
```
Then, use the client to query your FileMaker database. Availble methods:
- `list` return all records from a given layout
- `find` perform a FileMaker find
- `get` return a single record by recordID
- `create` return a new record
- `update` modify a single record by recordID
- `delete` delete a single record by recordID
- `metadata` return metadata for a given layout
- `disconnect` forcibly logout of your FileMaker session (available when not using Otto Data API proxy)

Basic Example:
```typescript
const result = await client.list({ layout: "Contacts" });
```

## TypeScript Support
The basic client will return the generic FileMaker response object by default. You can also create a type for your exepcted response and get a fully typed response that includes your own fields.
```typescript
type TContact = {
    name: string;
    email: string;
    phone: string;
}
const result = await client.list<TContact>({ layout: "Contacts" });
```

## Automatic Type Generation
This package also includes a helper function that will automatically generate types for each of your layouts. Use this tool within a package script to easily keep your types updated with any schema changes in FileMaker during development. ðŸ¤¯

The generated code uses the [`zod`](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) library so that you can also implement runtime validation for all calls to the Data API.

The example below also assumes you have have the [`dotenv`](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) package installed in order to use the same environment variables that you defined in the node script.

```typescript
// sample node script
import DataApi from "../src";
import { generateSchemas } from "../src/codegen";

// load environment variables
import dotenv from "dotenv";
const result = dotenv.config({ path: "./.env.local" });
if (!process.env.OTTO_API_KEY) throw new Error("No API key");

// initialize client, like normal
const client = DataApi({
  auth: { apiKey: process.env.OTTO_API_KEY },
  db: process.env.FM_DATABASE,
  server: process.env.FM_SERVER,
});

// run codegen, passing in schema for each layout that you want to generate types
generateSchemas({
    client,
    schemas: [{ layout: "customer_api", schemaName: "Customer" }],
});
```
Assuming you have a layout called `customer_api` containing `name` `phone` and `email` fields for a customer, the generated code will look like this:
```typescript
// schema/Customer.ts
import { z } from "zod";
export const ZCustomer = z.object({
    name: z.string(),
    phone: z.string(),
    email: z.string(),
});
export type TCustomer = z.infer<typeof ZCustomer>;
```

## FAQ
**Do I have to install `dotenv` or `zod` for this package to work?**  
No. Those packages are only required if you want to use the automatic type generation feature. The pure DataAPI client installs all its neccesary dependencies automatically.

**Why are number fields typed as a string?**  
FileMaker will return numbers as strings if the field is empty. The important thing is that
